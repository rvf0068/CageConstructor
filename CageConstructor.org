* Notes

- Currently the program can find sucessfully cubic graphs with excess
  and small girth.

* todo

- [ ] print more information, for example:
  - [ ] how many feasible edges to choose from
  - [ ] the score to decide to add, or delete an edge
  - [ ] whether the edges added equal the edges removed, and how many
    times this has happened.
  
- [ ] define a pos dictionary for trees
- [ ] make a table of tests
- [ ] implement (as an option) that all edges returned in the same try
  have age equal to 1, and the rest have their age incremented only
  by 1. Currently, if the edges e1, e2 are added, e1 will have age 2,
  e2 will have age 1, and the rest have their age added by 3.

#+TITLE: Newcages

* Notes

- Currently the program can find sucessfully cubic graphs with excess
  and small girth.

* todo

- [ ] age can be measured with the ntry the edge was introduced, just
  like 'whendeleted'.

- [ ] print more information, for example:
  - [ ] how many feasible edges to choose from
  - [ ] the score to decide to add, or delete an edge
  - [ ] whether the edges added equal the edges removed, and how many
    times this has happened.
  - [ ] how many vertices have the 'wrong' degree, with the count of
    each such wrong degree.

- [ ] define the small cages (and maybe the graphs with small excess)
  so that one can compare results)

- [ ] send email (optionally) when SearchForGraph finishes

- [ ] define a pos dictionary for trees, for making pictures of the
  graphs produced

- [ ] make a table of tests

- [ ] implement (as an option) that all edges returned in the same try
  have age equal to 1, and the rest have their age incremented only
  by 1. Currently, if the edges e1, e2 are added, e1 will have age 2,
  e2 will have age 1, and the rest have their age added by 3.

- [ ] keep a list of the graphs produced, classified up to isomorphism.

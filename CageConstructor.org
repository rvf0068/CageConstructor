* Notes

- Currently the program can find sucessfully cubic graphs with excess
  and small girth.

* todo

- [ ] define a pos dictionary for trees
- [ ] make a table of tests
- [ ] implement (as an option) that all edges returned in the same try
  have age equal to 1, and the rest have their age incremented only
  by 1. Currently, if the edges e1, e2 are added, e1 will have age 2,
  e2 will have age 1, and the rest have their age added by 3.
